Reducer just a simple function that to transform the old state to new one
Each reducer has 2 arguments :
ex: const nameReducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        casse LOGIN:
        break
        default:
            return state
    }
}
export default nameReducer;

index.js in reducer is rootReducer which combine all reducer we do action,and map by key
ex: 
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    key: namReducer
})
